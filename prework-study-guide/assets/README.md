There are four sections in this project: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Each of these sections contains notes that can be used as a study guide. In order to choose which section to study you can navigate to the console in DevTools. In the console the JavaScript that we created will run and choose a section for you to study. You can then navigate to that section and begin to go over the notes.
